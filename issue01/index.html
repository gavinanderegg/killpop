<p align="center"><i>from this issue's editors...</i>

<p align="justify">Things change; they have to. News is changing. Not in the obvious way, the global community shrinking and everything going to Hell; rather, the very way we gather and perceive news is on the brink of becoming something new. Years ago minstrels and messengers dispensed news, and it worked for a very long time. Then came the printed word, and a written form of the news could be distributed cheaply and quickly. This didn't destroy the minstrels though, and their influence is still felt today. The telegraph, the radio and the television all had the same effect, they allowed the news to be distributed more quickly and in greater depth and the minstrels adapted to each change, the ones who embraced the new media were incorporated with those who scorned it and those who corporatized it to make the dizzying array of media available now.

<p align="justify">The Internet is the newest frontier, and it bears more resemblance to the oldest form, the minstrels, than the later ones, as anyone can tell a story, be it around a campfire or in a geocities chat room. While, at first, even the whole body of independant journalists on the Internet cannot compete with the BBCs and CNNs with the sheer volume of news processed and speed with which it is made available, we can offer one thing that they cannot: objectivity.

<p align="justify">In their quest to be an objective news source, the conventional media, whether intentional or not, self-censors and contorts everything to their own ends. Case in point, being branded a liberal (a real liberal, not a Couric type morning show liberal) kills one's career in American media, and all news reported is twisted far to the right, in order to serve the ends of the oil families who, in the end, own the media corporations. Now, just in time to save us from a cultural wasteland of Vonnegutian proportions, where everything is filtered and spoonfed for the lowest common denominator, comes the Internet. Now everyone who has the slightest ambition can become a newsmaker; even without the money for a computer and a connection I could go to the library and start a free homepage account and get my opinion where you can see it. This whirlwind of opinions and thoughts will change the way we read the news, from the refined and prim message Big Brother broadcasts to us to the opinions of geniuses, crackpots, and extremists from both sides of an issue or story. The result is like light: one colour of light alone is just that, one colour, while the three main colours (RGB) together look pure and white. But to obtain a true white light we need to take every colour of the spectrum and blend it together, which our brain will interpret as completely and truly white. So must we take these opinions and understand them all so we can find the truth.

<p align="justify">As far as journalism and information is concerned we are at the brink of a golden age. We must all assume the responsibilities we are given and unmask every dark corner both in the world around us and in ourselves. Everyone can be a part of this world we're building, a world without borders, races, genders, or ages. It could be like a new America, like America tried to be and wishes so hard it was. In the words of Doug, "Rock and roll, Man! Freedom of speech!"

<p align="justify">A word of caution to you, who has stumbled on this site possibly unawares.

<p align="justify">While it is trite and cliché to offer a warning of this sort, I believe that it is in order anyway. This webzine is not exactly what we'd call "all audience". Anything and everything published on here is more than likely to offend someone in some way. People are like that. Before you stuff our, the editors', email boxes with garbage detailing why, in what way, and how often you hate us, then bear in mind one simple fact: This site is full of conjecture and opinion. We are by no means claiming to have all the right answers, or even any right answers. Our writers may even disagree. We do not, however, condone being stupid because of what we say. However terrible you may believe we are, we are in no way implying that you have the right to lose your faculties of thought.

<p align="justify">The point is, we are all equipped with a special piece of machinery called a brain. Generally (and this is forgotten all too easily these days) this tool is used in a certain type of action called "thinking", which some of us do on occasion to avoid a certain class of actions called "stupid". Be a part of the first group.

<p align="justify">Here's in hoping that this webzine accomplishes its real goals, to encourage ideas and thought to flourish, and to expose readers to thoughts that aren't necessarily spawned from that bloated monster we call Popular Culture.
