<p align="justify">There's a problem... or a phenomenon that's been identified as a problem,
anyway. We've all been told that to act without thinking is a bad thing...
of course, there's some flaws in that argument, <i>as a general
argument</i>, but I'm concerned with only the extreme case: to think
<i>without</i> action, or to allow one's thinking to interefere with the
success of one's actions.<br>
<br>
We (er, if you're cool, you know who <i>we</i> are - if you're <i>really</i>
cool, you're one of us) call this phenomenon <b>OVERTHINKUNDERACT</b> - a
big nasty word, designed to confuse the brain into <i>freaking out</i>
before it can really realize what to do about it.<br>
<br>
<i>What the hell does that mean?</i> You're right... we need to go deeper.
Why do you think it is, that all the assholes are getting the women? Hm? Is
it 'cause women like assholes? - no, not really. There's a bunch of theories
involving confidence, and they work rather well, but I'm worried about
<i>mojo</i> here. You see, if you're in the groove, you'll get the
bananas.<br>
<br>
You're always in the groove - or a groove - but some grooves have rotten
bananas. Grooves host to rotten bananas are known as ruts - "rut" being (in
this case) short for "rotten" (wholly because I said so - QED) - it's a
rotten groove - a rut.<br>
<br>
Whatever it is you want, given a system of grooves and ruts, it's not a
rotten banana. That's how the health of the banana is determined in the
first place... what you want is a healthy ripe banana.<br>
<br>
Ergo, you've got to be in the right groove (or <i>the groove</i>) or you'll
get rotton bananas, which you don't want. The problem is, the ruts suck.
Literally. They suck you in... you must be in motion or you're headed for a
rut. If you're out of motion for too long, you'll end up <i>in</i> a rut. As
we all know, ruts take a <i>lot</i> of energy to get out of.<br>
<br>
Overthinking, or underacting will, obviously, get you into a rut. I'm not
going to worry about overacting, since you're parents have already warned
you that jumping into a deep well is a bloody stupid thing to do. Unless you
can find some good bananas down there, of course. Bananas make you strong,
and give you superpowers, such that you can scale walls and stuff... but I
digress.<br>
<br>
So, anyway, assholes getting all the hotties... doesn't that piss you off?
Okay, here's the breakdown. Play by play. Asshole wants a hottie. He hits on
her - right away. Why? 'Cause he's a big dumb jock and he's not bright
enough to think about it.<br>
<br>
So... asshole gravitates towards the groove. You, what are you doing. You're
thinking about it... you're worrying about rejection, or perhaps about being
creepy, or maybe... oh, I don't know... the point is, you're thinking about
it, 'cause you're a nice guy, eh? Well... let's look at the scoreboard,
you're getting sucked into a rut, and Mr. Hole himself is getting in the
groove.<br>
<br>
What's the deal here? Well, given this trend, you'll end up in a rut -
whining to your friends that you never get any dates, while Mr. Asshole is
with the hottie. He's got the good bananas. Yours stink, man.<br>
<br>
Let's look at this conventionally... how does this relate to things people
can accept literally? Well... he tried, you just sat there and sipped on
your club soda. The least you could have done was gotten plastered enough
that you stopped thinking, and were left to act - or pass out.<br>
<br>
I guess the point is that action begets action, and inaction begets a
subscription to a stroke magazine.
