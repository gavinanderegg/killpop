<p align="justify">Some people may peruse this
k-rad website and wonder to themselves, &quot;what can I do to be
like those guys? I wanna be a POP-KILLER!&quot; Until now, you
probably didn't even know you wanted it, but damnit, now you want it.
The best way to go about this is by making a list of goals and
working at them one at a time until one day, in the distant future,
you find yourself emotionally damaged and embittered toward the
entire world. You, the uninitiated may not have the wisdom and
insight to make such a list, but here at KP, we do, so we made one
for you. Here it is:</P>

do if you are a frequent reader of this page and you want to be like
us is to obtain a plain black shirt and some white paint (whether
you use normal, a more practical or decidedly more nefarious means
of obtaining things is left completely up to yourself). Then you
take your paint and write 'Kill Pop' on your shirt. This shirt is
your badge of honour, wear it when you have nothing else clean. Now
that you have the base KP shirt you can produce more shirts in the
same manner. Although you should be creative, here are some
suggested slogans to show the world you're a weirdo:</P>

<LI><P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next thing to do is
to learn to tell people that you don't like them. Our new revolution
will be founded on honesty, and in an honest world everyone deserves
to know exactly what you think of them. Beating around the bush by
being rude to somone is obsolete; tell them you don't like them,
they leave you alone. This simple equation is too often forgotten
and people we don't like irritate us for too long without being
properly disuaded. However, the power to use language properly
should be used wisely and a few guidelines should be kept in mind
when your god-like potence is brought to bear: never tell someone
you dislike them in anger, you could burn your bridges with someone
you actually do like; don't tell someone you dislike them if you
think the situation might change, this is when just being a little
rude is appropriate; don't laugh or be mean when you say it, an
honest and unsarcastic affirmation allows for no mistakes and
sometimes keeps a lack of affection from degenerating into hatred.</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Separating yourself
from the rest of society is the next step. There are no real actions
to take, merely the aquisition of the attitude of an outcast and the
real feeling of abandonment. This is easier than it sounds: too
often people who are not actually losers go around telling people
that they are dark and mysterious, and therefore like the cool
people at Kill Pop and Stylish Pants. They are not like us. If you
do not already feel this way the best thing to do is to move to a
city where you don't know anyone, then look out the window and think
about how alone you are. This works even better if you have no
friends or family to talk to, but this is sometimes hard to muster,
so I might forgive you if you can't.</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nextly, you have to
bottle up everything. No venting of any sort for a long time is the
only way you can possibly hope to match the ball of latent rage that
is a POP-KILLER. After you feel angry enough, you are allowed to
vent, but only allow a loss of control on inappropriate things; it's
ok to get mad at stuff you're allowed to get mad at, but only get a
little mad. Then go screaming ape-shit over bumping into inanimate
objects and stupid things you do to yourself.</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, you write. Since
no one wants to talk to you any more and you can't stand to have a
whole conversation with stupid people, you will have to rely on
writing angry monologues for the internet. They should be long
winded, sarcastic, and completely honest in a way that conventional
media cannot be. You don't need to pull punches on the internet
because people will stop reading if they're offended. Plus, if they
are offended, you can't see them cry and they can't kick your ass,
which is good, since others crying around might lead to some
uncomfortable emotion on your part, and asskickings suck.</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final thing you
have to do is get a goal in life. In light of the other things to
do, this might seem strange, but it's not, as not just any goal will
do. The goal must be something that is both unattainable and
probably not all that satisfying when attained. Then you must tell
yourself that you are working toward this goal, even though you are
doing nothing of the sort, like writing angry web pages. Now you
keep this up for a few years until the soul has been sucked
completely from your body and all that remains is a wasteland of
self pity and regret with this little goal glowing in the
background.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Do all of these things and
you will be a POP-KILLER of the 12<SUP>th</SUP> degree. What this
accomplishes? Our brave explorers of the understimulated are still
trying to find out.</P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oh yeah, being heinously
jaded, or at least amused by the wrong things, helps too.</P>
