<p align="justify">	I'm going to drop my usual guile and poetry for once (this would be a little more convincing in a later issue, but this is my attempt at being somewhat topical) and cut straight to the meat of the problem. The whole world has gone to hell. I'm not an American, but I too felt threatened by the recent political events. There are right ways of dealing with things like this and wrong ways. President George W. Bush has chosen the wrong way.
<p align="justify">	The first and most glaring error he made was in his assignment of the blame. Osama bin Laden, reprehensible, evil, and anti-American though he may be, was most likely not the culprit, in any way. This is because he is a terrorist (a terrorist that the US made, but that's another story) and terrorists work a certain way. Terrorists claim responsibility for lots of things, even things they didn't do, largely because it saves them work if something is attributed to them that someone else did. Sure enough, within minutes of the second plane hitting the WTC, CNN, CBC Newsworld, and most likely the BBC had reports of several groups claiming responsibility. bin Laden and his cronies were not among these groups. To not bother to claim responsibility for something he did is out of character for any terrorist, and, in this regard at least, bin Laden is no exception. Further more, in a taped interview he specifically denied his part in it and in any of the anthrax activities that followed. This could be viewed as a clever way of trying to get away with something awful, but it's not, as he's being punished either way. This 'war' is an atrocity being perpetrated against an 'innocent' man and his people.
<p align="justify">	If this logical evidence is insufficient, Colin Powell, the US. Secretary of State stated in an <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/23/ret.powell.proof/index.html">interview</a> that he is "absolutely convinced" that bin Laden is responsible for the attacks. In order to see the significance in this one must take into account the number of people Powell's little slip had to go through to get to me. Mr. Powell is, of course, not allowed to lie, especially to the American people on matters that will not be helped by a lie. The use of the words "absolutely convinced" imply opinion, while saying that bin Laden is responsible implies certainty. Certainty requires actual evidence, while opinion does not. Powell was not allowed to express certainty for this reason: when it becomes evident that it was not bin Laden, as I'm sure it will eventually, Powell cannot be held legally or morally responsible for thinking it was bin Laden, but were he to say that it certainly was bin Laden and evidence to the contrary were made public, he and the entire Bush government would be proven either liars or idiots.
<p align="justify">	Finally is the FBI. Any rube, in this case myself, investigating the FBI's page and looking at 'America's Most Wanted' will dicover that Osama Bin Laden is among them, but he is not wanted in connection with the September 11th events. He is wanted in connection with the embassy bombings he has claimed responsibility for! That is because there is insufficient evidence connecting him to the WTC attacks to charge him, so such claims cannot be made by the FBI.
<p align="justify">	Watch the fucking news, kids. You might learn something.
<p align="justify">	The second error that lovable goof the Americans decided could be a president has made is where his war is being fought. Crimes of terror and hate aren't all perpetrated by masked arabs with bombs on airplanes, a great many happen on American soil every day. The members of the KKK walk the streets freely during the day whilst innocent Islamists (and in at least one case a man of hispanic descent, mistaken for one of arabic descent by some ignorant prick) are the targets of a new well of hatred. This is by no means a new thing, though, nor is it something in the distant past. Anti abortionists kill doctors who perform abortions and women who seek them, the KKK is the fucking KKK, and all sorts of extreme right wing groups hate and hate and hate. Why are these American self righteous bigots any better than Afghani self righteous bigots? They aren't, but Bush allies himself with almost all of the American ones (he's anti abortion, a born again Christian (not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but it comes with too much baggage), supports the Bob fucking Jones pissing University, and as soon as I get a concrete link between him and the KKK you will be the first to know) the American ones haven't blown up his favourite fascist phallic symbol recently.
<p align="justify">	In short, if the Americans want to blow the shit out of someone they should be up front about it, and they should clean up their own house before they start trying to clean up everyone else's.
