<p align="justify">I recently took a class from a very wise man; a gentleman of Indian descent, who is one of the wisest men whom I have ever had the pleasure to hear speak.  He missed a week of class at one point, on account of the fact that he had gone to New Zealand to sit on a panel discussing the major problems of the world today.  On the panel with him was an important lama, a high-ranking official in the Tibetan government in exile.  This man spoke out concerning competition;  for there is nothing more troublesome or frustrating than the absurd competition of the contemporary Western and Westernised world.

<p align="justify">The argument against competition begins in frustration.  This is precisely the beginning of the end of competition; for it marks the disenchantment with the bad existential and post-modern judgements that have been plaguing us of late.  The eradication of the desire for more and larger and better is not the only critique of this article; the desire to overcome another, to lessen what is seen as the value of the overcome, is another form of competition - in other words, desiring less and worse and smaller as well.  It too must be rooted out.

<p align="justify">This is not to say that all competition is perverse - indeed, much of competition is not.  For instance, the competition one might expect in a game or sport is far from perverse; the point of the exercise is to attempt to overcome the other player or team, and to win the game.  This is not to say that this is all that is involved in the thing; such a definition is broad and vague.  What is improper in competition is to believe that one can win in all things - for there are many domains of living to which competition simply does not apply.  It is the unsupported belief that one can win at life that is the root of the problem.

<p align="justify">What does it mean to win at life?  Nothing.  This is the root of the difficulty.  One cannot win at life; there is no prize at the end, no trophy awaiting He-Who-Has-Died-With-The-Most-Toys.  At the end of life there is death.  More than that we cannot say.  Anyone who does say more is either much wiser than the rest of us (i,e., has some sort of direct connection to the afterlife), or a prating fool.

<p align="justify">What, then, does someone want if they desire to win at life?  Perhaps the competitive desire to be on a plane above that of the common man.  This is not so uncommon a desire: the Buddha himself wanted to be more than what anyone else was, but of course for a different reason.  We all in some way desire to be excellent, to be a_ _?eta_ (from the Greek, literally 'excellent or virtuous ones).  We all desire to be good at something, at the very least.  This is not an unhealthy thing, it is rather an internal drive which motivates us toward self-perfection - an admirable goal.

<p align="justify">Yet, if this is not the root of the pathology, from where does this unruly competitive desire stem?  What is its cause?  Some might say that the competitive desire stems from the evolutionary process - but we are, hopefully, as human beings self-aware enough to control our own urges and govern ourselves.  We are free, after all (or so we like to proclaim loudly to anyone else who will listen).  Is this dilemma, then, to be declared entirely the result of inheritance, and no thought given to environment?  While the root of the competitive drive may be ascribed to the primordial competition for survival which so dominated the Earth's past few billion years of history, the fact of its pathology can be, I maintain, placed squarely in an environment which provides no methods or practices by which we might govern our unhealthy competitiveness.  

<p align="justify">This environment is Western civilisation.  Now, before the cliché alarm goes off too loudly, let me explain; the rise of capitalism saw the West become increasingly atomised at the individual level.  Individual members of the society, as Rousseau or Hobbes might maintain, must be held together by some form of social contract, since they no longer believed that we had anything inherently in common with each other, no necessary bond.  Each member of the society could more and more regard himself (the masculine will be used here as indicative of the Race of Man, or humanity - so the feminists can stop prattling and clucking now) as a Parmenidean One within the context of a plurality of such unrelated entities.

<p align="justify">At this point I must return to my earlier comment upon which the philosophically-minded of the readers have jumped; especially if one happens to hold existentialism or post-modernism in some sort of regard.  The bad, and by that I mean false, erroneous and truth-obscuring judgements which have proceeded from the existentialist and later the post-modern programmes have been these: 1) "I have the right to be myself, and am not accountable for who I am"; 2) "I am a product of my past, my upbringing, and my culture"; 3) "Everyone is the same in the end"; 4) "I am a fragile and special flower."  These are all to some degree untenable, and lose the important contributions which have been made by these two schools of thought.  Moreover, when taken together, they lose all coherence and the position falls apart under its own power.

<p align="justify">1)	"I have the right to be myself, and am not accountable for who I am" -  This first statement is only partially correct, in that anyone does have the right to be themselves - who else do they have the right to be?  However, to assert the fact that one is unaccountable for one's undesirable behaviours, one's negative qualities, and one's personal downfalls is utterly preposterous.  This reduces the world, as I have previously stated, to a set of beings who are for all intents and purposes Parmenidean Ones.  The fact that one has the right to exist is not given by anyone - it is so merely by the fact that one does exist.  Everyone is, by the same token, an individual, but not a totally separate individual - and those who would choose to be confine themselves in a hell of their own making.
How are we not separate individuals?  How is our uniqueness not complete?  It is an incomplete (and marvellously so) individuality by virtue of the fact that we all more or less exist in the same way - we all have a basic makeup, which we could explain in physical terms by the laws that govern the universe, or DNA, or genetic inheritance.  The intellectual equivalent is that we are all shaped by our acquired opinions, our upbringing, and by our beliefs - a trait common to all people.  The spiritual (and here the "philosophers" will sniff and bitch about God, and by that I mean any absolute, not existing - ignorance and unrepentant stubbornness, I assure you) explanation is that we all have a sense that there is a truth to the world - whether that truth is that there is only personal truth, or that we all have common access to a ubiquitous and overarching truth, does not matter for the purposes of this discussion; what matters is that there is a sense of priority, a sense that there is something which will, when understood or acquired give our lives meaning in relation to it.  These commonalities allow for a great proliferation of individual perspective and growth, but only within that very certain range.
As for accountability, a person's actions are actions in the world, not in some magical realm where there are no consequences - if you drop a glass, it will fall, and quite possibly break.  You are responsible for your actions, you and no one else - another may force your hand, but in the end it is your hand.  This is what existentialism has taught us; the rest comes from the overextension of its possibilities, and from misreadings of quite good writings.

<p align="justify">2)	"I am a product of my past, my upbringing, and my culture" - The second bad judgement which has come to be widely accepted in the modern world, both contributes to, as well as offers a solution to, unruly competition is the reliance on the authority of the past.  I do not wish to claim that the past has no authority - I am a classicist!  Yet, to claim that one's personal past, upbringing, or culture is insurmountable, and thus responsible for character flaws, is ridiculous.  This implies that the will of man is not free, but in a way mechanically determined; however, the sense that the will as unencumbered by the weight of the past can make rational determinations concerning the world, which will be always closer to correct, is equally fatuous.  One must be concerned with the past, but not to the extent that it is incapable of making determinations apart from past experience.  There comes a point at which one must determine that the past or one's culture, while still a part of the psyche, must not dominate the personal moral compass, or the decision making process. While we are determined by our past and upbringing, etc, part of this being determined is the resolve to change what is wrong with us. This assigns responsibility to the individual, and what's more, frees us in a most definite way to be who we are.
Now, this is not to say that the past should be dispensed with - if we learn anything, it is from our past mistakes and successes.  What we must be careful of is the tendency to judge the distant past with our own standards, for as similar as the values of the past are to ours, they are often divergent as well - for instance, Plato's stance on eugenics.  We must also be wary of applying lessons from the past directly to our own world - we must not do just as the Romans did, for we are no longer in Rome.

<p align="justify">3)	Equally inane is the statement that "everyone is the same in the end." It directly contradicts several of the other principles too.  This is due to unquestioning acceptance of the stereotypes, and generalisations that we as consumers buy every day.  This maxim, that everyone is the same in the end, is almost entirely untrue, for individuals are at their core unique by virtue of their individual characters, their past, and their plans.  Individuals are, however, not totally separate in the sense that everyone has these traits, and that everyone shares the same basic needs.  Almost everyone communicates; in this realm we are both individual and corporate; our languages are common while being used in characteristically individual ways.  In the end, everyone has made themselves, hopefully, as individual as they can be; they have lived their lives making their own choices, and living by the consequences of those same choices.  What is important to remember while defining one's individuality is that others are also doing the same thing - and that therefore one must take care not to assert one's own uniqueness, be that in the form of opinions, beliefs or physical force, to the impairment of others.
In what sense, then, can individuality and this bond be held together?  If everyone is different, yet everyone is the same, have we not just gotten ourselves into a worse mess than even these statements have yet conceived?  Do we not have a paradox?  Indeed we do not.  We do not because our statements refer to different aspects of the human being - the individual is the internal realm, the psyche and mens interior, while the common human traits are shared by virtue of the fact that we all possess such a mens interior, and that these inner regions seem to be able to reach out of themselves and bridge the infinite gap between minds, at least to some extent.  In the end, everyone is not the same, and it is this which makes us human. 

<p align="justify">4)	The last and most odious of these misconceptions, and which lies at the root of all of these untenable and irresponsible assumptions is the statement that "I am a fragile and special flower."  Now, those who agree with this idea will rail against me for writing this, but we are not.  No one is anywhere near as fragile as they would have themselves believe; it is mere laziness of the mind and spirit that create such fragility.  Much as physical laziness will lead to a frail, inept and incapable body, so will mental laziness lead to a turpid, fatuous and easily injured psyche.  The insistence upon a certain fragility in the human is, however, true to some extent - the body can be hurt quite easily.  As well, the mind can be traumatised under certain circumstances, for we are not invincible nor immune to the influence of the world upon our minds.  Yet, to shy away from pain and suffering denies us an essential part of what life is - difficulty, striving, overcoming ourselves and the challenges posed by the world.
It is our relation to challenges and the suffering that ensues due to these ordeals that help define us in a very particular way.  They "build character", so to speak.  To constantly search for a way of life without danger or conflict, without challenge and innovation, leads to the insistence that being happy is the root good.  This is entirely untrue.  Being happy all the time would be boring, and dangerous.  To continuously search for a new and interesting kind of happiness - for all enjoyments lose their initial thrill - is to chase an endless stream of meaningless ambitions. Happiness is achieved at the end of a trial, not along the way.  This is not to say that happiness is a goal - it is the byproduct of constructive activity, and the side effect of suffering and challenge.
Now, these four misconceptions may seem to bear little connection to the competition of which we have lately been speaking.  This could not be farther from the truth.  These four statements leave us, when they are accepted and internalised, with little sense of responsibility, either for ourselves or to others.  If we are atoms, there is nothing to achieve but our own happiness.  This leaves us prisoners in ourselves.  What is necessary is a greater understanding of the world and its inhabitants, in order that we might as individuals and as a species progress to a more worthwhile state of being.  When we self-consciously  examines our actions, we find that many of our most trivial acts follow these four sad misconceptions.  These false ideas lead us to the state of unruly competition from which it is so difficult to escape.
