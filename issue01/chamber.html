COAL CHAMBER vs. THE CARE BEARS

<p align="justify">	<b>Coal Chamber.</b> Despite their outrageous appearance and loud, evil music, it has come
to my attention that these fiends might not be quite as fiendish as they would have you 
believe. "But gasp!", you gasp, "How can this be so? This is completely unfounded!" However,
it IS founded, for 'twas I who hath founded it. Yes, I have found the connection between
Coal Chamber and, prepare yourself here... THE CARE BEARS!

<p align=justify>	<b>The Care Bears.</b> Those loveable, huggable, cute little cartoons, the antics of which
so many enjoyed in their youth. How could it be that Coal Chamber, the dastardly, abrasive
heavy metal band, could be associated with such cuddliness? Well, let's take a look at some
of the lyrics from their album, "Chamber Music", shall we?

<p align=justify>	"Tragedy" - "Come with me I cannot lie. I'll tell the truth I cannot lie." 
Apparantly, Coal Chamber has a hard time lying. And not just a hard time. They CANNOT lie.
Who else cannot lie? The Care Bears. The Care Bears are just full of goodness, and lying is
bad, isn't it? So, if one were to lie, one would be bad. Therefore to be good, one must not
lie. Care Bears are good, so they can't lie. So there we have it that both the Care Bears 
and Coal Chamber "cannot lie".

<p align=justify>	"El Cu Cuy" - "Yeah I'm the one get under your bed increase your dreams and know it
well. Kill the man, become the monster." The first line is obvious. Increase your dreams?
Notice they did not say "nightmares", but "dreams". Could this be because dreams are good,
like the Care Bears? Perhaps to increase your dreams is to increase your affinity to the 
Care Bears? Interesting indeed. The second line, is not so obvious, but obvious nonetheless.
To kill is to become a monster. Monsters are bad, killing is bad. Who are the bad guys? Who
is constantly opposing the Care Bears? Noheart, Beastly, and Shrieky. The only one in that
bunch that isn't monstrous is Shrieky (Mind you, she's foul enough in her own way). So to 
kill is to become a monster, an enemy of the Care Bears. And the message behind this must be
that one should not become a monster, because one wouldn't want to project the image that 
killing is good upon all those impressionable youth that are listening to this music, that's
just plain wrong. So to kill is to become an enemy of the Care Bears, who would rarely turn
there back on anyone. A heinous crime indeed.

<p align=justify>	"Untrue" - "I'm Dead." This just screams that Coal Chamber themselves are Care 
Bears, or wish to be. Think about it. Where do the Care Bears live? In the clouds my friend,
in the clouds. Now what is the widely recognized portrayal of Heaven? Clouds. I'm dead. I'm
in Heaven. I'm in the clouds. I'm a Care Bear.

<p align=justify>	"Tyler's Song" - "Son if the sun don't shine, I'll try like hell to make light from
the dark for you." Now, it has been a while since I myself have seen the Care Bears, but if 
my memory serves me, when a group of Care Bears stares together, the result is a brilliant
rainbow. Or maybe they used rainbows for transportation, I can't remember. Either way,
rainbows were an integral part of the Care Bear lifestyle. What is a rainbow? Last time I
checked, it was the refraction and reflection of light. The Care Bears make rainbows. They
make light.

<p align=justify>	"Entwined" - "You tend to talk about the better things. Then let's move on to better
things." As I have mentioned before, Care Bears are a happy bunch. Their mission is to save
sad children and make them happy again, because they care (sorry, couldn't resist). They 
want the children to move on to better things. I think you can figure it out from here.

<p align=justify>	"My Mercy" - "In my life see I've loved an angel." And so we return to the clouds, 
the image of Heaven, the house of the angels. Now, if the Care Bears are in the clouds, and
the clouds are the house of the angels, the it would be conceiveable to use "angel" as a 
metaphor for "Care Bear", would it not? As they would likely prefer to keep their dark 
image that they've worked so hard to obtain, it wouldn't be wise to go right out and say
"I love Care Bears", but with some clever wording, they can get the message accross without
running the risk of your average metal-head discovering their secret passion.

<p align=justify>	"No Home" - I'm not going to quote any lyrics from this song, becuase there is just 
too much ground to cover. Just find a copy of the song that you can listen to, and you 
should be able to pick out with relative ease why the song is about the eternal battle 
between the Care Bears and Noheart.

<p align=justify>	And there is more. However, I feel that I have provided enough to, at the very 
least, allow you to open your own eyes and see that not all is as it seems. Of course,
it could all be a coincidence. And to quote Isaac Asimov, "...coincidences can be enormously
amazing --and enormously meaningless."*
