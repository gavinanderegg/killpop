<p align="justify">	Optimism is a disease. It is a festering sore which chews away at our society. 
However, unlike other dieseases, like cancer, optimism can be cured. One might think that 
once somebody has fallen in to the evil clutches of optimism there is no way out, which is
true and false. You see, to change your outlook on life, you must have a strong mind. The 
problem here is that optimists are generally weak minded people; how else could they be so
damned happy all of the time? However, nothing is impossible. For those with strong minds, 
we have spirits to break. For the idiots, we are unleashing their potential for 
intelligence.

<p align=justify>	To start off, you have to realize that one of the worst things about optimism is how
quickly and easily it spreads. It's a clever disease, and we have to be alert. You can't 
trust a carrier, so the first thing we shall learn is how to recognize an optimist. 
Those happy-go-lucky bastards can be recognized by any of the following traits:
<ul>
   <li> Smiles, just because they can
   <li> Enjoys "cute" things (puppies, children, pocket lint, etc...)
   <li> Wears bright colors
   <li> Says things like "Nice day out, isn't it?" seriously
   <li> Does volunteer work
   <li> Is under the age of 15
</ul>
<p align=justify>These are just the basics. There are many more subtleties in the optimist's behavior that 
you will learn to recognize on your own. Now, if you have noticed that you have any of these
traits, don't worry. The fact that you are reading this is a step in the right direction.
For the remainder of the article, we will deal exclusivly with self-treatment. Treatment of
others will be covered in "How to Kill Optimism II: The Happy Hunter".

<p align=justify>	The first step on the road to recovery is proper fluid intake. Namely, coffee. Drink
it. Lots of it. This will make you edgy and irratable, a good mindframe to be in. And don't 
take anything in it; the blacker the better. Cream/milk and/or sugar corrupts coffee much 
the same way opimism corrupts the world. It defeats the purpose. It's like talking to a 
prostitute: Waste of time, money, and everything else. So get your ass to Tim's right now
and order an Extra Large Black. Don't worry, I'll still be here when you get back. Come to 
think of it, bring me one too.

<p align=justify>	Step two is to learn the lingo, so to speak. Not so much vocabulary, but technique.
You have to know how to speak your mind. Optimists lie a lot. That's a sin, isn't it? Then 
wouldn't that make an optimist a sinner? Hmmm, what else is considered a sin? Stealing? 
Adultery? Murder? Rape? You see, optimists are just one short step away from going to hell.
You don't want to go to hell, do you? So you have to be honest with people. If you think
someone is a "fucking moron", you have to tell them. Otherwise, how will they know? Now that
we know what to talk about, let's get pissed off doing it. This is realy easy; all you have
to do is mumble a lot. If you mumble, people can't hear you very well, and you will have to
repeat yourself often. This should really get on your nerves after a while. And of course,
you should make this known (honesty!). Here is an excellent example:

<blockquote>
   &lt;Bob> Boy, sure is a nice day out, isn't it?
<br>   &lt;Me&gt; Bob, you are a fucking moron.
<br>   &lt;Bob&gt; I'm sorry, could you repeat that? You were mumbling and I couldn't quite make it
         out there, friend.
<br>   &lt;Me&gt; I said, "BOB, YOU ARE A FUCKING MORON, YOU DEAF SHIT EATING SON OF A BITCH."
<br>   * Bob stares blankly
</blockquote>

<p align=justify>You see how that works? Now you're ready to try it out on your own. I see your coffee's
getting a little low. Why don't you take another trip to Tim's? Don't forget to mumble when
placing your order!

<p align=justify>	Now that you're starting to act the part, you need to look the part. Now some of you
might be thinking that I'm going to tell you to go out and buy all the black leather and 
spiked collars you can get your grubby little paws on, but you're wrong. Wearing black 
leather and spikes just makes you look like a wannabe goth reject from the 80's, and that's
not what we're after. Our primary goal is comfort. And we like to stay away from big names
like Tommy Hilfucker and the like. My personal preference is a comfortable pair of pants and
a t-shirt emblazoned with any band that's worth listening to. If none of my band shirts are 
clean, I'll just grab something plain than was picked up at Zeller's for $5.00. By wearing
comfortable clothing, we accomplish two things. A) We are comfortable; and B) We look like
we don't give a rat's ass (which we don't). In fact, for more tips on clothing, take a look
at "How To Be A Pop-Killer". There you will find excellent advice on making your own 
clothing.

<p align=justify>	Let's take a minute to talk about the sun. The sun the source of all evil in this 
world. Why? Let me ask you this: What does "Lucifer" mean? Isn't it something like "light
bearer"? And what does the sun do? It bears light, does it not? You see, the sun is the 
Devil. Being the crafty bastard he is, Satan has managed convice the optimists of the world
that he is good, he is a source of good energy, he is a source of light. But NO! Satan gives
you skin cancer! Beelzebub blinds you with light! Avoid the sun. Live in darkness and 
artificial light. Never go outdoors without sunglasses (unless of course it is night time;
we are avoiding Satan, not intelligence). Sunglasses allow you to see through The Horned
One's shroud (Another bonus is that if you're glasses are really dark, people can't tell
what you're looking at ;P).

<p align=justify>	The fifth step is connected to the third, as it relates to language. This time, we
are all about sarcasm. You have to be sarcastic whenever possible. It annoys other people,
which will annoy you. Eventually, you will get to the point where even when you are trying
to sound serious you will come off as being sarcastic. Many people will have a hard time 
telling if you are serious. They will think you are being an ass, and probably won't talk
to you about things of no importance. If you use sarcasm well, you may never again hear such
phrases as "Boy, sure is warm out, eh?", for people will know that polite conversation is 
wasted upon one who has been cured. Which brings us to step six. 

<p align=justify>	You see, trivial conversation is meaningless. Otherwise, it wouldn't be trivial, 
would it? It wastes your time, it wastes the other person's time, and it's just a big (you
guessed it) waste. Optimists believe that trivial conversation is polite, and somehow will
allow you to become better friends. Anyone that believes that a good chat about the weather
will give you a deep insight into one's soul needs to be cured, and for them the first step
is a good boot in the ass. If you don't waste time with pointless conversation, you have 
more time to discuss important matters, like whose turn it is to pay for the movie rental
(or trick new people into paying lol aha); and more time to accomplish important things
like building that homemade record player.

<p align=justify>	So there you are. Six easy steps which will help you greatly on your road to 
recovery. Mind you, this is only the beginning. As you journey further from the land of
ignorance, you will begin to pick up more on your own. And that is the way it has to be.
To be cliche, I can not steady the bicycle. I am only the training wheels which get you used
to the, uh... oh, fuck it. I've got better things to do. Next time, we'll learn how to cure
someone else. Until then, try not to smile.
