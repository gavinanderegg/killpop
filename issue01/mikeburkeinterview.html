<p align="justify">We had the opportunity to interview Mike Burke, the sysadmin of the <a href="http://snowball.darktech.org/">Snowball</a> network about his experiences running a webserver, and with the Internet in general.

	<blockquote><font size=-1>
<p align="justify">&lt;Kill Pop&gt; How long have you been an Internet user?

<p align="justify">&lt;Mike Burke&gt; 6 years.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Wait, that's a lie.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Maybe only 4.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; heh
<br>&lt;KP&gt; Okay, so... you'd say that you're fairly knowledgable about the Internet?
<br>&lt;KP&gt; Just, in general...

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Yeah. I've done a fair bit of stuff with it.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; How do you feel about the recent trend on the Internet, of websites turning 
  away from the old-school, content-rich pages to the pretty pages that really have 
  nothing in particular to offer?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; "Pretty" - that's a matter of opinion. :P
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Seriously, there're still a lot of content-rich pages.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; You just have to know how to find them, and weed them out from the junk.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Ah... are you finding that it's getting harder to do that? Find the good 
  stuff, I mean?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Nope. If anything, it's getting easier - there are more pages now, and that 
  includes more pages with useful information.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; (Of course, there are a bunch of repeats/mirror-wannabes, too.)

<p align="justify">* KP nods
<br>&lt;KP&gt; Is there anything that you'd say concerns you about snowball in particular, 
  and about the Internet in general?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Not really.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Okay, good enough... Is there anywhere that you'd like to see 
  snowball go eventually? Anything you'd like to do that you haven't yet?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Well, I don't have any specific things in mind. Like, some people 
  want to start a hobbiest ...something-or-other. I just want to familiarize 
  myself with anything that comes up.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; The only thing I can think of is UNIX system development.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Or system development in general, really... Or... Development in 
  general, since I don't do much of that.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; So just, development of whatever strikes your fancy?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Yeah.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Particularly networking.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Any particular applications of networking?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; TCP/IP. But that's pretty general.... so, it's all good.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Okay, cool.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; Uhm... some more general internet stuff now...
<br>&lt;KP&gt; What do you think the place for small servers/web groups as 
  opposed to huge servers like geocities or AOL will be in the next 10 years?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Well... You know how raindrops work, right? like, you have two small 
  puddles and then they eventually combine with the help of smaller drops to 
  form a bigger puddle. But it's recursive, those two puddles were formed the 
  same way.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; I think that happens with servers.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Also I wanted to make an analogy, even though I'm really bad at it.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; But I think that happens with servers/organizations.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; No, that's okay... I see what you what you mean.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; They build up, and combine efforts, etfc.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; etc, even.

<p align="justify">* KP nods.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; Okay, right... another question about Snowball... Have you had 
  any particularly positive or negative experiences as admin of Snowball that 
  you'd like to share?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Well, the positive has been keeping it running error-free. I've had 
  a few bumps, but they're all sorted out now.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; But the negative, well, I've had a few incidences, none too big...
<br>&lt;MB&gt; My ftp server was turned on anonymous, so random people on the net 
  started using it for transferring files. I went on one day and it was full 
  of various... educational programs.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Well, not really full, But they were there.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Ah... I see.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Also I get the various DoS attacks, but that's no problem. They 
  don't last long, they're easy to recover from...
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Other than the ftp issue, nothing particularly interesting has 
  happened.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; So it's been fairly smooth sailing then?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Yep. I'd say I've been lucky, except I don't think I can really 
  expect problems -- I haven't done much to warrant them.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Okay.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; So... some more personal (gasp!) questions now...

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Snowball's single. :}

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Hehehe.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; I'll make sure everyone knows that.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; You do that.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; But yeah, seriously... There's been a lot in the last while about 
  new anti-terrorist sentiment well, everywhere, and some grumblings about 
  classifying "hackers" as terrorists.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; What are your feelings on that sort of thing, and how hackers are 
  viewed by the general populace?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Me? Hack? Never!

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; I wasn't implying anything!

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Oh. okay.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Just looking for your views on the subject.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Well, I haven't heard much about that. But I would say most people 
  consider hackers as a kind of terrorist, yes..
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Things like, "hackers make all the viruses like 'DON'T FUCKING OPEN 
  ME' and stuff and they should die :<"
<br>&lt;MB&gt; But that's not true.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Hackers wrote FreeBSD, which Snowball, and, among millions of 
  others, Yahoo runs on their servers.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; The thing is, there are malicious hackers, and ones that aren't so 
  malicious -- maybe a little mischievous, though....

<p align="justify">* KP nods.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; But the primary hackers do so not to hurt other people, but to help.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Some hack remote systems, to find out if the administrator missed 
  anything in security, and then afterwards lets them know so they can fix it.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Unfortunately, some people misinterpret even this. I have heard of 
  people getting arrested for trying to help.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; In any case, I find most hackers are civil. They're really just 
  programmers.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Virus writers belong to the small group of malicious hackers.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; What are your feelings on these malicious hackers?
<br>&lt;KP&gt; They're the ones you hear about most, because they make the 
  headlines...

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; That's a good question...
<br>&lt;MB&gt; I don't know. I don't mind them going after me, because it gives me 
  something to do. (Unless they really try, because brute force might get me)
<br>&lt;MB&gt; But I don't think they really should attack other places
<br>&lt;MB&gt; .
<br>&lt;MB&gt; That's just how they think, I guess? I don't know what goes on in 
  their minds.

<p align="justify">* KP nods.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; All right... just a few more questions here to wrap up...
<br>&lt;KP&gt; So, what's been your favourite OS over the years?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Hmm, I don't know.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; I've always had a soft spot for OS/2, since it was really the first 
  capable, stable OS I used. (Driver support forced me to drop it.)
<br>&lt;MB&gt; (It could run DOS, Windows 3.1, 95, and UNIX programs!)

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Ooo...

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; But now, it really depends on the task.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; And it comes down between Linux and FreeBSD.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; I really really like FreeBSD. A lot.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; But I only run it on snowball, and not on my main system, fireball.

<p align="justify">* KP nods.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; I run Linux on fireball, because it's gotten more popularity, and 
  more support from vendors. For example, NVIDIA made drivers for their 3D 
  cards for Linux, but not FreBSD.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; +e
<br>&lt;MB&gt; And there are other things, too, but that is the main one right 
  there.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Otherwise, they're very much alike, except for the many annoying 
  inconsistencies found in Linux that aren't present in FreeBSD - my main 
  reason for preferring BSD.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Okay, that's cool.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; So, in your opinion, who let the dogs out? And why?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; You are so dead.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Okay, moving right along...
<br>&lt;KP&gt; Do you have any favourite websites that you'd like to share/plug?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; I like Google, <a href="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a>, as a search engine. Doesn't sell out 
  to companies so that their results will arrive higher on the list despite 
  relevance.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; The Dilbert Zone is great, since I don't get Dilbert in my paper. 
  <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/</a>
<br>&lt;MB&gt; I like cinnamon rolls.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; There aren't many web pages I visit.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; All right, good enough... any last words for our readers?
<br>&lt;KP&gt; Maybe a thought-provoking quote or a loud string of expletives?

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Last words..? What? Are you going to kill me?? AGAIN???!? Because I 
  don't think you want to do that.
<br>&lt;KP&gt; No no no... just for the interview.

<p align="justify">&lt;MB&gt; Oh.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; Yeah, okay.
<br>&lt;MB&gt; These are my last words.

<p align="justify">&lt;KP&gt; Okay.
