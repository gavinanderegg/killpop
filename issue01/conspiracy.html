<p align="justify">Many
people are confident in their place in the world. In a ball of action
and reaction (which is debatable, but I'll save that for later) as
complex and unpleasant as the world we know and can't escape, nothing
can be certain. If thinking about this doesn't make you shiver, then
you haven't been paying attention.</P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> The
greatest thing about the world is the only thing we can be certain
about. DesCartes said it and DesCartes was right (about this, at
least): the only thing one is certain about is one's own thoughts. I
really like my thoughts, they're the best thing about me. I like my
thoughts so much that it doesn't even bother me that my most
brilliant thoughts don't get shared with everyone else, so very few
people actually realise how smart I am. This leads me to the
frightening part; No matter how smart I seem to be, there is always
someone smarter than I am. Now, I'm pretty darn clever: I find I'm
able to learn to do almost anything, with a few small exceptions, I
know a little bit that's relevant to nearly every situation that
crops up... blah blah blah... I'm just great. But, still, there are
people who are smarter. Add to this equation the fact that given my
brains, abilities and destructive inclinations are all sufficient for
me to be a danger to society as we know it.</P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> It seems
to be human nature to be afraid of people who are smarter than you
are. The evidence is everywhere, from the school-yard bully who
punches the shit out of the kid who can do math, to the strict
controls on intellectuals at universities through grants and ethics
committees, to the countless persecutions and attacks upon
intelligent people and free thinkers everywhere. This is the greatest
conspiracy of all. It reaches every where and everyone is on one side
or the other, some changing sides at times, and most don't even
realise that it is beneath their feet.</P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> So, now
that we have pointed out the global conspiracy to keep down the
intelligent, let's flesh it out a bit. This conspiracy is led by
stupid people. Somewhere at the middle of this pecking order of evil
is the government (I'm lumping all governments together here, for
simplicities sake), an archaic dinosaur that can't feel it's own ass.
Modern governments are almost universally arbitrary buracracies in
place to hold people in their social caste and trade resources to
keep them out of the hands of people who can use them effectively. On
top of that, governments are run by small minded fucking buffoons;
albeit, they are usually charismatic, but this does not make them
suitable rulers! My life and the lives of those like me should not be
controlled by Stockwell Days, George Bush Jr.s, Mike Harris's, and
Jesse (the thought that this man's opinion can actually be taken
seriously makes my ears bleed and my eyes go dry with rage (in
response to the Colorada shootings a few years ago he said, &quot;It's
no wonder our kids are shooting each other if we're telling them that
they're glorified monkeys in school.&quot; This is as direct a quote
as I can give, as it happened a long time ago and I didn't think to
record any references. This particular speech was in support of
several states making it illegal to teach anything but good old
Christian creationism in schools), and he's <I>a fucking US
governor!</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">) Venturas. The fact
that the system allows people to elect these men and others like them
into positions of power is only proof that people are too fucking
stupid to be allowed to vote. I can't wait until 2012 when Stone Cold
Steve Austin and The Rock determine </SPAN>the identity of the
president of the United States with the 2K + 12 Electoral Smack Down!
and Stockwell Day, fed up with the insufficiently conservative
Canadian <FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 6pt">still just the Reform</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
Alliance</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> Party and forms the new No Coloureds and
No Queers Party (I wrote this well before the whole 'everyone hates
Stockwell' fiasco. Oh well, it proves my point, and I'll bet that
whoever replaces him will be no better). Where the fuck do we think
we're taking ourselves?</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT SIZE=3> A
step or two above the government is religion. The inherently bad
aspects of religion are obvious to anyone who has managed to read
this far. The problems with every religion are discussed ad nauseum
everywhere and I don't have the stamina or desire to discuss them
now. The problems are there though, and even the religious must set
down their little symbols eventually and recognise them, unless
they're stupid, in which case they'll go on violating their own rules
and trying to find solace on the other side of a quarter until, well,
I don't know when it will end, but I wish I could have something to
do with it. If you have read this far and you don't see what I'm
saying, you either skipped a bunch and should go back, or you are
just fooling yourself. Close your eyes and think about it until you
cry. I know I did.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT SIZE=3> To
get to the point, religion/conspiracy-wise though, there is potential
within religion to do quite a bit of the old citizen screwing. Don't
look to the most obvious culprit, the one that every
thought-protection-hat-wearing paranoid</FONT> will leap to, the
Christian church (I'm, of course, doing a bit of lumping here. The
Christian sects aren't as different as they insist they are, and what
differences exist aren't worth killing each other over). The
Christian church has had its heyday, and the inquisition was a long
time ago. The only real danger from Christianity to the common man is
from groups of religious yahoos (I'm talking about the type who burn
crosses into lawns and pitch rocks at Jews here, people intelligent
enough to read this far probably shouldn't be offended by the term
religious yahoo, because it shouldn't apply, whether they are
religious or not. If it does apply to you though, you should be
fucking ashamed, and there's simply no better way to put it) and
politicians, judges and other officials who don't properly understand
the meaning of 'Separation of church and state', a phrase that
appears both explicitly and implicitly in the <SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">constitutions</SPAN>
of both Canada and the <SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">United
States. No, the only conspiracy behind the Christians is the same
conspiracy that gives stupid people power.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent"> The
so called 'new age' religions have some conspiracy value, but this is
mostly a business arrangement type of conspiracy. </SPAN>As much as
the world needs to be overtaken by some genuinely peaceful tree
huggin' goths, religious enlightenment doesn't come at twenty bucks a
pop and one should probably be skeptical of people with names like
Ravenwood Silvermoon. Likewise, most of the appearance of eastern
religions in North America is designed to siphon funds from the
dissaticefied. Infact, the availability of instructional manuals on
Buddhism, the pre-packaged Zen rock gardens (I actually have one of
these, but it was a gift and I think it looks nice), the expensive
meditation retreats and the pricy Feng Shui decorators are all pretty
contrary to the DIY tendancies of most of the religions and
traditions they claim to have grown from. Aside from the accumulation
of currency, there is no real dangerous activity one could accuse
these religions of. </P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> Now lets
look at a possibly dangerous religious group. The Scientologists!
This is not to say that the average Scientologist is a danger; the
average Scientologist is frankly not too bright. I don't even want to
say that the Scientologists are the only bad ones, they're just a
good example. Scientologists have built their little cult up into a
sizable religion with the help of Hollywood stars and a careful
tailoring of their tenets to appeal to the ego of everyone who can
overlook a logic gap the size of a Studebaker. Scientology seems to
be designed to make people feel smart, as the name might suggest.
They offer their own intelligence test (the 'scientometric test' if
you can actually believe it) to anyone who will take it, presumably
to single out likely members. The 'problem' with this is that smart
people are simply too smart to fall into it. I haven't heard of
anyone reknowned for their intelligence and/or wisdom, or even a
single member of Mensa (note the separation of the two groups) who is
a Scientologist. This, however, works in Scientology's favour, as
anyone can tell you that a religion's success (on reflection, I think
this applys more to the westen word than to the eastern) relys on
building a base of followers that feels that their participation in
the said religion makes them better than other people and doesn't
think about it too much. Simply put, if you replace 'is really smart'
with 'will get into the magical paradise' you get Christianity. The
creators of Scientology are either idiots, who think themselves
smarter than the people who tell them that they aren't all that
bright, or they are genius's, who just may be taking over the world
as we speak. It terrifies me to think that some day Alec Baldwin and
Keanu Reeves could be revered as men of vision and intelligence for
embracing Scientology so early on. Keep in mind, however, that I
don't think those nutty scientologists are into targeting individuals
for persecution, at least until a few of them read this. I'm onto
you, you stupid bastards.</P>
<P ALIGN=justify STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> Let's
move on to the military. The military is an obvious source of
paranoia. They've got more guns than the people do (in a sane world,
at least), technology that people aren't allowed to know about,
sufficient beuracracy to make the normal government blush, and
completely legal and government sanctioned brainwashing camps. Well,
it shouldn't take Fox Mulder to find the danger in a gang of
homophobic brainwashed soldiers, armed to the teeth with high tech
gadgets I probably haven't even imagined yet. To be fair, we are
involved in a war, of sorts, but can that really justify everything?
They're out there, and that's scary. Aside from the obvious killing
and brutal beating, what can they do to us though? Simply put, the
army is fast moving and very close mouthed. Aside from a few
incidents in the gulf (do you remember that? There was to be a super
secret amphibious attack somewhere in the Persian Gulf (give me a
break, I was like 10) and the American press was waiting on the shore
when the boats landed) the military is always way ahead of the press.
Unlike the press, the military also knows that not everything needs
to be revealed to the public right away. The problem here is the same
problem that goes with censorship and traditional education, and
media too, to an extent; the information we recieve is the
information that <I>someone else</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
has deemed neccesary and suitable for our consumption! Nobody needs
to tell me what I am allowed to know; if the remains of an
unidentifiable craft were found in the desert in Arizona, I should
know, just like I might like to know who Madonna was marrying were I
able to scrounge up the hindquarters of a rat from the dark pits of
my empty soul. What our society has decided is appropriate
information for the general public is based on some grotesquely
arbitrary and nonsensical standard that I don't feel I should be
forced to be a part of.</SPAN></P>
